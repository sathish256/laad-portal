          <h1>Frequently asked questions:</h1>
          <div class="accordion">
          <h3>Do I qualify for a loan?</h3>
          <div>Your agribusiness company or project must be located in Mexico, Central America, South America or Caribbean to be eligible for a loan. We do not conduct business or give loans to companies or fund projects located in other regions including the continental United States. Our loans are also typically granted to either small to medium-sized privately owned agribusiness companies or projects that export all or part of their production.
          </div>

          <h3>How much can I borrow? </h3>
          <div>Our loans typically range from US$200,000 and up to US$3.0 million. Some exceptions are made on a case-by-case basis.  
          </div>
          <h3>What type of loans or products does LAAD offer?</h3>
          <div>We offer medium-to-long-term loans and revolving lines of credit. LAAD loans are typically used to fund investments in fixed assets (purchase of land, agricultural equipment, irrigation systems, etc), refinance debt, and, in some cases, for crop financing. LAAD has a profound knowledge of local markets and is specialized in agribusiness, so we understand our client’s needs especially during hard times.</div>

          <h3>How do I contact LAAD to initiate a consultation,and what are the typical steps to obtain financing?</h3>
          <div>The best way to initiate a new consultation with LAAD is to contact one of LAAD’s field offices covering the country in which your company or project is located. Contact names and details can be found on this website. Once the contact is established, we will: Discuss your financing needs, and visit your company, project or farm to determine interest. Discuss, negotiate, and agree on a basic structure for the loan (amount, interest rate, repayment schedule, collateral, etc.) that meets your specific needs. If deemed viable, we will prepare a comprehensive analysis covering mainly client history, industry analysis, project description, financial analysis, and security evaluation. The analysis of the proposal is completed totally within LAAD, and your business and financial information is held in strict confidentiality by LAAD.</div>

          <h3>How long does it take for a loan to be approved?</h3>
          <div>After the first meeting, the loan analysis is approved within 4 to 8 weeks.</div>

          <h3>Which documents do I need to qualify and obtain a loan?</h3>
          <div>We will initially ask you for financial statements, deeds on properties, local bank and commercial references, and personal identification documents.
          </div>
          <h3>What are the typical terms and conditions of a LAAD loan?</h3>

          <div>We will determine interest rate and loan maturity by evaluating several factors, including your product type and quality, market risk, size of your company or project, country risk, credit history, and overall relationship with your banks. Our typical loan term is 5 to 7 years.</div>

          <h3>Once approved, when and how do I receive the loan?</h3>
          <div>We will typically disburse a loan in about seven to ten working days after approval.</div>

          <h3>Do I need to pay any fees prior to obtaining the loan?</h3>
          <div>We normally charge a closing fee that is paid at the time of the disbursement. Fees depend on several factors, including the type and size of your credit request.
          </div>
          <h3>Will I need to personally guarantee the loan?</h3>
          <div>LAAD loans are supported by real guarantees on property or equipment. We may also request additional personal guarantees depending on the value that is placed on such property or equipment. The type and value of guarantees depend on several factors including credit type and risk.</div>

          <h3>Is my privacy protected?</h3>
          <div>LAAD’s policy is to keep our existing and potential client information secure and confidential at all times.</div>

          <h3>How do I pay my loan?</h3>
          <div>We will send you an invoice periodically with clear instructions on how and where to make payment. During the negotiation process we will determine what payment mechanism is best for you.
          </div>
          <h3>What are the benefits of getting a LAAD loan?</h3>
          <div>There are many factors that make LAAD unique and extremely well-positioned to serve the people, projects, and countries that we work with. LAAD has a long history of successfully financing and supporting small-to-medium-sized farmers in good and bad times – this is very rare in the banking industry. By establishing a relationship with LAAD you will find a partner that understands your needs and will support you long-term. We also have extensive local and agribusiness knowledge, resources, and an international network of partners that are available to help you succeed.</div>

          <h3>What is LAAD's policy on environmental and social responsibility and how does that affect me?</h3>

          <div>Depending on the size of your project you will need to meet or show significant progress towards meeting the environmental and social laws in the country in which your project or company is located. Some projects may also be required to meet other specific environmental and social standards. We will discuss these issues with you during negotiations and determine the requirements for your specific case. We will work with you, and in some cases we may also provide financing to help you comply with our environmental or social responsibility requirements.</div>
