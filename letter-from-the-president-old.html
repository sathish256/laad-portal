            Dear Associates and Friends:</p>
          <p>
            Welcome to our newly redesigned web site. We trust you will find it more informative and user-friendly. This year 2017, we celebrate our 46th anniversary of operations and the web site innovation is part of a larger process that encompasses all employees and departments within LAAD. Furthermore, it marks our fifth year following the vision of becoming a US$1 billion sustainable financial institution by financing economically, socially and environmentally responsible agribusiness projects.</p>
          <p>
            We are pleased to report another year of strong financial results in 2016. Strong, but moderating in a tougher environment — like the agricultural economy overall. We are navigating a more challenging business cycle than we've seen in years. Since our start in 1970, we've been there through market ups and downs and have continued to support rural communities and agriculture by providing reliable, consistent service. We have a history of adapting to help customers overcome challenges so that future generations will have ample opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today we're in the midst of an agriculture efficiency cycle, when producers need to reduce operating costs to better align with current commodity prices. Lower commodity prices have contributed to slower growth in farmland values and falling net incomes. Interest rates are expected to rise, at least modestly, for the first time in a decade. Producers generally have entered this cycle with strong financial positions and risk management tools, as well as debt-to-equity ratios that are moderating, but manageable.
            </p>
          <p>
            Whatever economic cycles we face, LAAD is committed to keeping capital flowing through rural channels, capital that customers need to make their businesses successful, which means more jobs and economic growth, leading to more vibrant communities.
            </p>
          <p>
            Challenges for borrowers will remain pressing for the foreseeable future with increasing risk, uncertainty and volatility. As we pass our 46th-year milestone, we are firmly focusing on the future. This forward-looking mindset requires creativity and a willingness to change so that we can continue to fulfill our time-honored mission. It requires reinforcing our strong financial foundation, collaborating more closely with our customers, and achieving operational excellence so we can continue to support these initiatives efficiently and effectively.</p>
          <p>

            Thank You,</p>
          <p>
            Gustavo Martinez Cappetta<br>
            President &amp; CEO
          </p>
